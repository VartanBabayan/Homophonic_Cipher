## JavaFX Application that implements the `Homophonic Cipher`
## The UI has been constructed using [SceneBuilder] and connected via [UIController] inside the code
## Actually [UIController] is a backend while frontend is represented by [UIControllerFXML] and interprets by [JavaFX]

### Prereqsite: 
- add `[JUnit]` into the project to run tests
- add `[JavaFX]` support inside an IDEA you're working on

#
* Architecture constructed using [MVC] pattern
* Tested using [JUnit] framework
* Implemented UI with [JavaFX]
* Cross-platform
