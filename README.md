### The homophonic substitution cipher uses a correspondence table between the letters of the plain message. Each letter is supposed to be translated to a letter from another alphabet, number or even groups of characters. Consequently, the same letter may have several possible encryption and the same message will possibly have several possible encrypted versions
#
### The application consists of 4 parts. It's possible to run it as a console application, an app working via ui, a webapp, and eventually webapp connected with database
